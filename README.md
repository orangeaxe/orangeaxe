- 👋 Hi, I’m @orangeaxe
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and playing guitar, amongst other things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and css. I learned them twenty years ago, stopped and am not getting back in.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple (thats a mighty fine word) projects that will press my current level of skill and knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me... here is a good place for now.

I'll eventually update this with some code.
